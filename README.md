##Join the Beta!
Fill in [this](https://forms.gle/ZFK9Qib1Ya3yKR1w6) form and you will be invited to the google play closed beta channel. Test some new features before they hit the live app!

## Short Term Planned Future Additions      
- ~~Convert the algorithm to Kotlin so that I can lower the min-sdk to 18(ish)~~
- ~~Convert the rest of the app to Kotlin for future Joe~~
- Add support for different algorithm versions, so that dungeons generated in older versions don't change.
- Save created dungeons so that they don't have to get generated **every time** you choose it from the list.
